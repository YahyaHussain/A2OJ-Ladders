## [A. Beautiful Year](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/271/A)

It seems like the year of 2013 came only yesterday. Do you know a curious fact? The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.

Now you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.

#### Input
The single line contains integer y (1000 ≤ y ≤ 9000) — the year number.

#### Output
Print a single integer — the minimum year number that is strictly larger than y and all it's digits are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

#### Constraints
Time limit per test: 2 seconds <br>
Memory limit per test: 256 megabytes <br>
Input: standard input <br>
Output: standard output <br>

#### Examples
Input
```
1987
```
Output
```
2013
```
Input
```
2013
```
Output
```
2014
```

### Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()  {
    int year;
    cin >> year;
    bool distinct = false;
    while (!distinct)    {
        ++year;
        int a = year / 1000;
        int b = year / 100 % 10;
        int c = year / 10 % 10;
        int d = year % 10;
        if (a != b && a != c && a != d && b != c && b != d && c != d)
            distinct = true;
    }
    cout << year << endl;
}
```

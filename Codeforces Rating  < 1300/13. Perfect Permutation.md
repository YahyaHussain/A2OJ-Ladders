## [A. Perfect Permutation](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/233/A)

A permutation is a sequence of integers p1, p2, ..., pn, consisting of n distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed n. Let's denote the i-th element of permutation p as pi. We'll call number n the size of permutation p1, p2, ..., pn.

Nickolas adores permutations. He likes some permutations more than the others. He calls such permutations perfect. A perfect permutation is such permutation p that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (n is the permutation size) the following equations hold ppi = i and pi ≠ i. Nickolas asks you to print any perfect permutation of size n for the given n.

#### Input
A single line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the permutation size.

#### Output
If a perfect permutation of size n doesn't exist, print a single integer -1. Otherwise print n distinct integers from 1 to n, p1, p2, ..., pn — permutation p, that is perfect. Separate printed numbers by whitespaces.

#### Constraints
Time limit per test: 2 seconds <br>
Memory limit per test: 256 megabytes <br>
Input: standard input <br>
Output: standard output <br>

### Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()  {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    if (n & 1)
        cout << -1 << endl;
    else
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
            if (i & 1)
                cout << i + 1 << ' ';
            else
                cout << i - 1 << ' ';
}
```
